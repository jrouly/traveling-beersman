Given the name of a city, dynamically gnerate a route to visit all of the
major breweries.


ToDo:
* basic architecture:
  * entry page: type in name of city
  * map page: display map with route
  * information page: about the app, entirely static
* get a nice high res picture of beer
* vector art logo thing (stein? beersman?)
* data flow:
  * data ingestion
  * TSP logic
  * output to database
  * visualize data in map
